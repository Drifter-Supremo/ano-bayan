## UI Patterns
1. **Drawer Scrolling Implementation**:
   - Requires both CSS and JavaScript solutions:
     * CSS: `flex flex-col` on container, `flex-grow overflow-y-auto h-0` on scrollable element
     * JavaScript: `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` when drawer opens
   - Mobile considerations: `overscroll-contain` prevents background scrolling

2. **Component State Management**:
   - For toggle components, pass both state and setter (e.g., `isDrawerOpen` and `setIsDrawerOpen`)
   - State should be managed at the highest common parent level

## Firebase Integration
1. **Authentication**:
   - Uses `signInWithPopup` for Google Sign-in
   - Auth state is tracked via `onAuthStateChanged`

2. **Storage**:
   - Rules restrict access to specific UID
   - Always reference from root of storage bucket
   - Environment variables must be properly configured in `.env`

## Development Patterns
1. **Error Handling**:
   - Common issues include:
     * `storage/unauthorized` errors from incorrect rules
     * `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` issues with auth popups
   - Always verify Firebase project configuration matches local `.env`

2. **Deployment**:
   - Requires proper Railway environment variable setup
   - `client/.env` should be gitignored
