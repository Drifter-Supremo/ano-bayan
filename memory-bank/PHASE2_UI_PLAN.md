# Ano Bayan Slideshow – Phase 2: UI/UX Plan

## Core Principles
- **Minimalism:** Only show what’s needed, use whitespace, avoid clutter.
- **Beauty:** Subtle gradients, smooth animations, elegant typography.
- **Focus:** The image is always the star; UI elements never distract.
- **Dark mode/theme by default**
- **Responsive:** Simple, beautiful experience on both desktop and mobile (`@media (max-width: 768px)` for mobile tweaks).
