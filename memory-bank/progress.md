# Ano Bayan Slideshow â€“ Progress Log

## Session Date: 2025-04-20

---

## **Summary of Work Completed in This Session**

### 1. **Migration from Supabase to Firebase**
- Removed all Supabase authentication and storage logic from the codebase.
- Deleted all Supabase-related files and components.
- Implemented Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in) and Firebase Storage integration.
- Updated `.env` and `firebase.js` to use the correct config from the Firebase Console.
- Ensured all image fetching and playlist logic uses Firebase Storage APIs.

### 2. **Authentication Flow**
- Login page uses `signInWithGoogle` (Firebase) for authentication.
- Logout uses `signOutGoogle` (Firebase).
- `ProtectedRoute` uses Firebase Auth state to protect routes.
- **FIXED:** Added redirect to home page after successful login (was missing before).

### 3. **Image & Playlist Fetching**
- Home page fetches playlists (folders) from Firebase Storage and displays the first image in each as a thumbnail.
- Playlist page fetches all images in the selected playlist folder from Firebase Storage.

### 4. **Slideshow/Playlist Navigation Restored**
- Integrated prev/next buttons, keyboard arrow support, and swipe gestures into the playlist image modal using Firebase-loaded images.

---

## **Current State of the App**

- **Authentication:** Works with Firebase Google sign-in (styled button). Redirect after login is now in place.
- **Home Page:** Loads and displays playlists from Firebase Storage with thumbnails.
- **Playlist Page:** Loads and displays all images in a playlist from Firebase Storage.
- **Logout:** Works and reloads to login screen.
- **Playlist Drawer:** Slide-out folder selector and logout implemented (shuffle toggle removed).
- **Slideshow UI/UX:** Refactored `Slideshow` component handles preview (fade) and cinematic (fade+zoom, autoplay) modes. Browser fullscreen toggle added. Controls use SVG icons and auto-hide on inactivity.

---

## **Broken & Missing Features / What Needs to be Fixed ASAP**

1. **Slideshow/Playlist Navigation:** Fully functional (arrows, keyboard, swipe).

2. **User Experience Issues:**
   - After login, redirect to home page was missing (now fixed).
   - No feedback if login fails or popup is blocked.

3. **General:**
   - No error handling or loading indicators for failed image loads in modal.
   - No support for favorites/tags (planned features, not regressions).

---

## **Exactly How Firebase is Used in This App**

- **Authentication:**
  - Uses Firebase Auth (GoogleAuthProvider) for login/logout.
  - `signInWithGoogle` triggers a Google sign-in popup.
  - `signOutGoogle` logs out the user.
  - `onAuthStateChanged` is used to track login state and protect routes.

- **Storage:**
  - Uses Firebase Storage to list all folders in the `ano-bayan-images` bucket.
  - For each playlist (folder), lists all images and fetches their download URLs.
  - Home page displays the first image in each folder as a playlist thumbnail.
  - Playlist page displays all images in the selected playlist folder.

- **Environment:**
  - All Firebase config values are loaded from `.env` and match the Firebase Console.

## **What Needs to be Done**

- [x] **Slideshow/playlist navigation, cinematic mode, and UI polish implemented.**
- [x] **Updated browser tab title and favicon.**
- [x] **Styled Google login button.**
- [x] **Removed shuffle toggle from drawer.**
- [ ] **Add error handling and user feedback for login/image loading failures.**
- [ ] **Review all navigation and authentication flows for any other missing "common sense" behaviors.**
- [ ] **(Optional) Refactor modal/slideshow logic for reuse and maintainability.**

## **Summary of Work Completed in This Session**

### 1. **Migration to New Firebase Project**
- Cloned existing project to a new machine.
- Created a new Firebase project for the application.
- Updated client-side `.env` with new Firebase project credentials.

### 2. **Troubleshooting and Debugging**
- **Issue:** Initial `storage/unauthorized` errors when accessing storage.
  - **Diagnosis:** Incorrect Firebase Storage security rules in the new project.
  - **Resolution:** Updated Storage rules to allow authenticated users to read from the `ano-bayan-images` path.
- **Issue:** `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` errors and `runtime.lastError` during Google Sign-in with `signInWithRedirect`.
  - **Diagnosis:** Potential incompatibility or environment-specific issues with `signInWithRedirect` on `localhost`.
  - **Resolution:** Switched Google Sign-in method back to `signInWithPopup`.
- **Issue:** Not navigated to home page after successful `signInWithRedirect`.
  - **Diagnosis:** Timing issue with authentication state handling after redirect.
  - **Resolution:** Attempted to fix authentication state handling in `ProtectedRoute.jsx` and `LoginScreen.jsx`. (Note: This fix was later reverted).
- **Issue:** Persistent `storage/unauthorized` errors referencing old storage path (`ano-bayan-images`).
  - **Diagnosis:** Application code still referencing the old storage path.
  - **Resolution:** Updated storage reference paths in `client/src/components/Home.jsx`, `client/src/components/Drawer.jsx`, and `client/src/components/PlaylistGridView.jsx` to list from the root of the bucket.
- **Issue:** Build errors ("symbol already declared") after debugging code removal.
  - **Diagnosis:** Duplicate import statements in `client/src/components/LoginScreen.jsx`.
  - **Resolution:** Removed duplicate import statements.
- **Issue:** Playlists not listing after recent code changes, despite correct storage rules and authentication.
  - **Diagnosis:** User identified that playlist listing was working before a specific code change and reverted it themselves. The root cause of the temporary failure after the revert was not fully diagnosed during the session.
  - **Resolution:** User resolved the playlist listing issue independently after reverting a code change.

### 3. **Deployment Preparation**
- Provided formatted Firebase environment variables for Railway deployment.
- Added `client/.env` to `.gitignore`.

---

## **Current State of the App (as of end of session)**

- **Authentication:** Works with Firebase Google sign-in (`signInWithPopup`).
- **Storage Access:** Authenticated user with specific UID has `read`, `write`, and `list` permissions for all paths in Storage. Playlists are listing correctly (user confirmed).
- **Build:** Application builds successfully.
- **Deployment:** Environment variables formatted for Railway. `client/.env` ignored by Git.

---

## **Exactly How Firebase is Used in This App (Updated)**

- **Authentication:**
  - Uses Firebase Auth (GoogleAuthProvider) for login/logout.
  - `signInWithGoogle` triggers a Google sign-in popup.
  - `signOutGoogle` logs out the user.
  - `onAuthStateChanged` is used to track login state and protect routes.
  - Uses `signInWithPopup` for Google Sign-in.

- **Storage:**
  - Uses Firebase Storage to list folders and fetch image URLs.
  - Accesses folders and files directly from the root of the storage bucket.
  - Storage rules restrict `read`, `write`, and `list` permissions to a specific authenticated UID.

- **Environment:**
  - All Firebase config values are loaded from `.env` (client-side) and should be configured as environment variables in the deployment environment (Railway).
