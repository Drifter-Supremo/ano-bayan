## **Summary of Work Completed in This Session**

### 1. **Migration from Supabase to Firebase**
- Removed all Supabase authentication and storage logic from the codebase.
- Deleted all Supabase-related files and components.
- Implemented Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in) and Firebase Storage integration.
- Updated `.env` and `firebase.js` to use the correct config from the Firebase Console.
- Ensured all image fetching and playlist logic uses Firebase Storage APIs.

### 2. **Authentication Flow**
- Login page uses `signInWithGoogle` (Firebase) for authentication.
- Logout uses `signOutGoogle` (Firebase).
- `ProtectedRoute` uses Firebase Auth state to protect routes.
- **FIXED:** Added redirect to home page after successful login (was missing before).

### 3. **Image & Playlist Fetching**
- Home page fetches playlists (folders) from Firebase Storage and displays the first image in each as a thumbnail.
- Playlist page fetches all images in the selected playlist folder from Firebase Storage.

## **Current State of the App**

- **Authentication:** Works with Firebase Google sign-in. Redirect after login is now in place.
- **Home Page:** Loads and displays playlists from Firebase Storage with thumbnails.
- **Playlist Page:** Loads and displays all images in a playlist from Firebase Storage.
- **Logout:** Works and reloads to login screen.

## **Broken & Missing Features / What Needs to be Fixed ASAP**

1. **Slideshow/Playlist Navigation BROKEN:**
   - Left/right arrow key and button navigation between images in a playlist (slideshow functionality) is missing.
   - Modal for image preview does not support cycling through images with arrows/keyboard.
   - Previous slideshow logic exists in `Slideshow.jsx` but is not wired up to real playlist images.
   - **Slideshow.jsx contains full slideshow logic:** left/right arrow navigation, keyboard support, swipe gestures, progress indicators, etc. **BUT:** It uses a hardcoded `imageList` and `basePath`, not the Firebase playlist images. It is not currently integrated with playlist images loaded from Firebase.

2. **User Experience Issues:**
   - After login, redirect to home page was missing (now fixed).
   - No feedback if login fails or popup is blocked.

3. **General:**
   - No error handling or loading indicators for failed image loads in modal.
   - No support for favorites/tags (planned features, not regressions).

## **Exactly How Firebase is Used in This App**

- **Authentication:**
  - Uses Firebase Auth (GoogleAuthProvider) for login/logout.
  - `signInWithGoogle` triggers a Google sign-in popup.
  - `signOutGoogle` logs out the user.
  - `onAuthStateChanged` is used to track login state and protect routes.

- **Storage:**
  - Uses Firebase Storage to list all folders in the `ano-bayan-images` bucket.
  - For each playlist (folder), lists all images and fetches their download URLs.
  - Home page displays the first image in each folder as a playlist thumbnail.
  - Playlist page displays all images in the selected playlist folder.

- **Environment:**
  - All Firebase config values are loaded from `.env` and match the Firebase Console.

## **What Needs to be Done**

- [ ] **Restore slideshow/playlist navigation:**
      - Add left/right navigation (arrows and keyboard) to the image modal in PlaylistGridView.
      - Integrate or refactor slideshow logic so it works with Firebase-loaded images.
- [ ] **Add error handling and user feedback for login/image loading failures.**
- [ ] **Review all navigation and authentication flows for any other missing "common sense" behaviors.**
- [ ] **(Optional) Refactor modal/slideshow logic for reuse and maintainability.**
