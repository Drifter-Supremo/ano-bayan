# Ano Bayan Slideshow – Progress Log

## Session Date: 2025-04-19

### **Summary of Work Completed This Session**

#### 1. **Home Page (Playlist Gallery) MVP**
- Implemented a React Home page that fetches playlists from the backend and displays them as a stylish, responsive grid of thumbnail tiles.
- Used Tailwind CSS for modern styling (rounded corners, hover effects, grid layout).
- Refined the layout to remove playlist titles for a cleaner, gallery-style look.
- Ensured the gallery is desktop-focused and visually immersive.
- Added a subtle hover effect to thumbnails.
- Added click handler placeholders to playlist tiles (ready for routing to grid view).

#### 2. **Background Color & Layout Robustness**
- Solved persistent white space issues by setting the background color (#032934) on `html`, `body`, `#root`, and `.hero` via global CSS, guaranteeing full-viewport coverage on all screens and orientations.
- Ensured that no matter how many tiles are present, or how the window is resized, the background remains consistent and immersive.

#### 3. **Testing & Debugging**
- Used Postman to verify backend API endpoints (`/api/playlists`, `/api/playlists/:playlistName`).
- Confirmed frontend fetches and displays playlist data as intended.
- Diagnosed and fixed issues with Vite proxy config and Tailwind CSS setup.
- Iteratively improved grid layout and background handling for maximum simplicity and reliability.

## **Phase 2.2 (Current Phase) – Playlist Grid/Album Preparation**

### **Last Completed Step:**
- Finalized the Home page playlist gallery with robust, full-viewport background and clean, minimalist tile grid.

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Implement Playlist Grid View:**
   - Create a new page/component to display all images in a selected playlist (photo album style grid).
   - Add routing so clicking a playlist thumbnail opens its grid view.
2. **(Optional) Detail/Preview View:**
   - Clicking an image in the grid opens a larger preview/detail modal or page.
3. **(Optional) Overlay Features:**
   - Add overlays for tags, favorites, or info when hovering/tapping on images (per Phase 2.2 plan).

## **General Notes**
- All changes prioritized simplicity and maintainability.
- No unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
- All UI/UX decisions aligned with the minimal, stylish, desktop-focused vision for the app.
