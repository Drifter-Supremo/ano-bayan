# Ano Bayan Slideshow â€“ Progress Log

## Session Date: 2025-04-19

### **Summary of Work Completed This Session**

#### 1. **Authentication & Environment Setup**
- Investigated persistent environment variable issues affecting both Firebase and Supabase auth.
- Discovered that Vite requires the `.env` file to be in the `client/` directory for environment variables to load.
- Moved `.env` to the correct location, resolving the issue.
- Successfully implemented Supabase Google Auth and a login page.
- Added a ProtectedRoute component to guard the home page and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.

#### 2. **UI/UX Progress**
- Login page now displays correctly when not authenticated.
- Home page is accessible only after login.
