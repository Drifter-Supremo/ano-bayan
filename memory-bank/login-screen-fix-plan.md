# Login Screen Scrolling Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis
- The current implementation has two competing centering mechanisms:
  1. Global body-level flex centering
  2. Component-level flex centering
- This creates a "fight" between the two flex containers, potentially causing unwanted scrolling

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Modify Global Styles (index.css)
Remove centering from body and keep only essential resets:
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  min-width: 320px;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### 2. Maintain Component-Level Styling (LoginScreen.jsx)
Keep the current component styling as it follows best practices:
```jsx
<div className="min-h-screen w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-[#032934]">
```

### 3. Additional Optimizations
- Add `overflow-x-hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling
- Add `overscroll-contain` for better mobile experience (as per project rules)

## Implementation Strategy
1. First modify index.css to remove conflicting styles
2. Verify the fix works on desktop
3. Test thoroughly on mobile devices
4. Add mobile optimizations if needed

## Mobile Considerations
- Use `overscroll-contain` to prevent background scrolling on mobile
- Ensure responsive image sizing
- Test on various screen sizes
